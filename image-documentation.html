        <title>libnexpod Image Requirements</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>About</h1>
        This document describes the requirements a libnexpod image is supposed to have.
        <h1>Filesystem</h1>
        The Filesystem is expected to roughly follow the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.<br>
        Additionally the directory <code>/usr/libexec/libnexpod/</code> must exist which should also be the place in which the libnexpod-host-shim should be installed.<br>
        Since users may want to use podman or libnexpod inside of a container, a symlink from <code>/usr/bin/podman</code> to the host-shim must exist and the package manager must know about this. This includes that the shim package has podman as a conflict and but also that it provides podman's capabilities, so that packages depending on podman can work without modification, as if they are executed on the host.
        <h1>Installed Utilities</h1>
        A minimal set of Posix utilities should exist by default, but as a must have there are:
        <ul>
            <li><code>useradd</code></li>
            <li><code>usermod</code></li>
            <li><code>groupadd</code></li>
            <li><code>sudo</code></li>
            <li><code>sh</code> installed at <code>/bin/sh</code> or a valid symlink</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
